##Task 1.

The first program generated dataset with tickets and counts implementation time.
The program creates tickets on 30 min periods by default. If you want to change it, change the freq variable. 

- Notes on the test:
The test checks if the created dataset has any problems with calculating the implementation time. 
As the generated dataset has tickets that were created or closed during holidays, some tickets may have 
the same implementation time.

##Task 2.

The second task compares time of evaluation similar functionality made with pandas and with postgres. 

To start the postgres program, follow that README.md.
