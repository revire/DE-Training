This is a task for MapReduce done with Dockers.
The program counts bytes in archives. 
It makes computation two ways:

- simply with python 
- in docker

To use just with python:
- uncomment line 54 in docker_test.py 
- comment line 51 in docker_test.py
- run docker_test.py

To use with dockers:
- uncomment line 51 in docker_test.py 
- comment line 54 in docker_test.py
- run start_cluster.py
